## Hello, I'm Ally! \o/

I'm a junior software developer with a technical background in Information Technology,
focused on frontend and backend development. I have hands-on experience building
collaborative projects using React and TypeScript, as well as solid foundations in
backend development with Java and PHP.

I enjoy working on real projects, writing clean and well-organized code, and using
Git and GitHub as part of my daily workflow. I'm currently seeking junior opportunities
where I can grow technically and contribute to real-world solutions.
